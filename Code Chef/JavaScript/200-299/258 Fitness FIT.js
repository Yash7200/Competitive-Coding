//Problem Simplification:
    //Chef wants to stay so he goes & comes from office by walking 5 days in week
    //Total Distance = distanceToOffice * 2 * 5

//Logic for string to Integer:
    //We'll receive no. of testcases & testcases Input in separate new lines as string.
    //Use method chaining.
    //Remove white space around input using trim method.
    //Split the input by newline which will convert input to array of strings. which will look similar as ["2" , "1", "2"]
    //Pass such array to strToInt function call
    //Create a function to convert string array to integer
    //Remove the first element using shift method as we don't need it & we won't process
    //[Note: chaining the shift method during function call will cause runtime error.]
    //create a variable which will strore output of map method used to iterate over all array items of string Array.
    //Each array item will be a string from that string we need to convert it into integer using Number function.
    //Inside Number function, use trim method to remove white space around input of testcase.
    //return this integer array.
    //Now we can apply logic to solve the problem.

//Logic to solve Problem:
    //Create function containing core logic to solve problem.
    //Use forEach method to iterate over items & pass testcases as parameter of arrow function.
    //In side arrow function, call the function & pass testcase
    //In function declaration, create variable holding multiplication of distanceToOfiice with 2 and 5.
    //We are multiplying with 2 because Chef coming from & going to office.
    //We are also multiplying with 5 because he do it 5 times per week.
